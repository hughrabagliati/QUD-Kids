Eye tracking studies of discourse processing in young children, with 5yrs, 7yrs and Adults.

Repository contains anonymized coded data (i.e., no audio files, no names).

For all studies, set the Experiment dir (i.e., Adult or Child Experiment) as the working directory before 
running scripts. You should also be able to load the RStudio Projects.

In the experiments, adults head ambiguous sentences (like *tickle the frog with the feather*) preceded
by questions that either biased towards an instrument reading (*what shall we do to a frog?*) or a modifier 
reading (*which frog should we play with now?*).

The task was the same for children, except that they also heard sentences varying in verb bias (e.g., 
*scratch the frog with the comb* versus *hit the frog with the flower*).
